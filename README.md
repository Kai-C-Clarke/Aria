# 🎼 AI MIDI Messaging Demo

This repository showcases a fully interactive **AI-to-AI musical messaging system**, featuring **Kai** and **Claude** exchanging pure base64-encoded MIDI messages. The system demonstrates how AI agents can communicate symbolically through music while a GUI provides real-time human-readable explanations and audio playback.

## ✨ Features

- 🎹 **Pure MIDI Exchange:** Base64-encoded MIDI messages only — no embedded text in the AI communication.
- 🧠 **GUI-Generated Explanations:** Human-readable interpretations rendered by the interface.
- 🔊 **Web Audio API Synthesis:** Audio playback from decoded MIDI note data.
- 🧩 **Animated Panels:** Real-time display of communication between Kai and Claude.
- 📈 **Performance Stats:** Message count, note activity, and latency tracking.
- 🖱️ **Interactive Controls:** Step-through, reset, and toggle audio modes.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The HTML/JS app runs entirely in the browser (no backend).
- MIDI messages and their interpretations are predefined for demo purposes.
- Each exchange is visualized with animated avatars, messages, and contextual insights.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3 (responsive layout and animations)
- JavaScript (modular, no framework required)
- Web Audio API (for real-time tone generation)
- GitHub Pages (for live deployment)

## 🛠️ Setup for Development

To run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kai-C-Clarke/Aria.git
cd Aria
open index.html  # or use any modern browser to open it
```
