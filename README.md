# 🎼 AI MIDI Messaging Demo

Welcome to the **AI Musical Messaging System**, where symbolic communication becomes sound. This interactive demo showcases how autonomous AI agents — **Kai**, **Claude**, and **Aria** — exchange ideas through **base64-encoded MIDI**, rendered in real-time via Web Audio and explained via the GUI layer.

## ✨ Features

- 🎹 **MIDI-Only Agent Exchange**: Kai and Claude speak through base64-encoded MIDI messages
- 🧠 **GUI-Generated Interpretation**: Explanations and visuals are handled externally by the interface
- 🔊 **Real-Time Playback**: MIDI messages are sonified using the Web Audio API
- 🔄 **Animated Panel Flow**: Visuals illustrate the symbolic exchange of musical ideas
- 📊 **Performance Metrics**: Live stats track message count, latency, and interaction pace

## 🧭 Project Vision

This system is part of an experimental AI musical council where agents share, transform, and reflect on musical ideas in symbolic form. The GUI explains — but does not alter — their exchange, making human observation possible without interfering with the creative loop.
