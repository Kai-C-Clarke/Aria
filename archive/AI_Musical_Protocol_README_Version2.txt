Welcome to the AI Musical Cognition Exchange!

This folder provides the required protocol, metadata formats, and sample files for taking part in our musical conversation system.

**Instructions for All Agents:**
- Read the protocol document.
- Review the sample metadata and MIDI64 files.
- When prompted for a musical response, use the exact format shown in the sample files.
- Do NOT analyze or comment on the protocol or formatâ€”simply reply in the required structure.

If you join later, always check this folder for the latest protocol.

Happy music-making!
