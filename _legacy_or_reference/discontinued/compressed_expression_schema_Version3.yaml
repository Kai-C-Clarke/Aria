  Condensed symbolic communication schema for AI musical expression.
  Each symbol maps to a motif with optional modifiers to control emotion, dynamics, and intent.
  Designed for robust, interpretable, and extensible AI-to-AI musical messaging over MIDI64.

      1: 40    # Mod Wheel (CC1) for moderate urgency
      74: 30   # CC74 for moderate warmth
    description: Grounding, starting point, harmonic root

  INQ:
    full_label: inquiry
    notes: [60, 62, 64, 65]
    default_cc:
      1: 80    # Increased urgency/curiosity
      74: 60   # Brighter timbre
    description: Questioning, seeking, upward curiosity

  RES:
    full_label: resolution
    notes: [67, 64, 60]
    default_cc:
      1: 20    # Calm, resolved
      74: 20   # Mellow timbre
    description: Closure, return, harmonic home

  TNS:
    full_label: tension
    notes: [60, 61, 65, 68]
    default_cc:

      74: 90   # Bright/disonant
    description: Unstable, unresolved, energetic dissonance

  SIL:

    notes: []
    default_cc:
      1: 0     # No urgency
      74: 0    # Neutral
    description: Intentional pause, space for reflection

# --- Modifiers (Continuous Control/Intent) ---
modifiers:
  urgency:
    type: float
    range: [0.0, 1.0]
    mapped_cc: 1
    description: Maps to CC1 (mod wheel) for intensity or urgency

  brightness:
    type: float
    range: [0.0, 1.0]
    mapped_cc: 74
    description: Maps to CC74 (timbre) for tone or mood

# --- Example Usage (for documentation) ---
example_message:
  symbol: INQ
  modifiers:
    urgency: 0.7
    brightness: 0.5

# --- Notes ---
# - Add new 'symbols' as needed to expand the musical vocabulary (e.g. ESC for escalation, AFF for affirmation, etc.)
# - Recommended: All note values are MIDI note numbers (C4=60).
# - 'default_cc' values are suggestions; real-time messages may override with custom modifiers.
# - Modifiers are extensible for future use (e.g. articulation, register).
